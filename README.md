WSO2 Complex event Processor (CEP) is.. Data Mining and Machine learning concerns on study and implementation of models that can learn from data to identify patterns, and is a fast growing aspect in the field of data processing. Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML based format developed by the Data Mining Group, to define models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms so that those can be used by other applications. Combining WSO2 CEP with such machine learning models enables monitoring, identifying and capturing patterns of the incoming events in real time.
